# Flutter configuration for development
# This file configures default settings for flutter run

# Note: Flutter CLI doesn't support port configuration via config file
# Use one of these methods instead:
# 1. VS Code Task: "Start Flutter App" (recommended - port 7777 is built-in)
# 2. Command line: flutter run -d chrome --web-port 7777
# 3. Launch config: F5 to use launch.json settings (port 7777)
